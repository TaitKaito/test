				<h2>HOW UNDER ARMOUR® BEGAN</h2>
				<p>Under Armour® started with a simple plan to make a superior T-shirt; a shirt that provided compression and wicked perspiration off your skin rather than absorb it; a shirt that worked with your body to regulate temperature and enhance performance. Founded in 1996 by former University of Maryland football player Kevin Plank, Under Armour® is the originator of performance apparel and gear engineered to keep athletes cool, dry and light throughout the course of a game, practice or workout. The technology behind Under Armour's diverse product assortment for men, women and youth is complex, but the program for reaping the benefits is simple: wear HeatGear®to stay cool, dry & light, ColdGear® to stay warm, dry & light, and AllSeasonGear® to stay dry, light & comfortable.</p>
